    <h3>A funny Poem by me</h3>
     <pre>
        I tried to bake a cake today,  
        But flour flew the wrong way.  
        The batter’s now stuck in my hair,  
        I think I’ll call it “despair” flair.  

        My socks are missing, once again,  
        I swear they’ve formed a rebel den.  
        One’s in the dryer, the other’s not—  
        I’ve lost a pair, but gained a thought.  

        I made a plan to clean my room,  
        But now I’m here, in sweet doom’s gloom.  
        I sat down “just to rest my feet,”  
        And now my nap’s a three-day treat.
