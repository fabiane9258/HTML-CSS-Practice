            <h1><span>Contacts</span></h1>
            <p>What do you mean contacts, back in my days we would use smoke signals,thats how companies that wanted me to work for them reached me. There is this time that the owner of company literally ordered for the company to be put to flames just to generate enough smoke for me to see it coz it was a bit far.I was in demand as you can see. It's actually crazy that you guys dropped those cool means of communication for what you call phones, like reaally brruh. Anyway my grandson said you could reach me with the info below.
